      "realWorldExample": "When a car suddenly stops, passengers continue to move forward.",
      "explanation": "An object in motion (the passenger) stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force (the seatbelt or dashboard)."

      "concept": "Newton's Third Law",
      "realWorldExample": "A rocket launching into space.",
      "explanation": "The rocket expels gas downwards (action), and the gas pushes the rocket upwards (reaction). For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."

      "realWorldExample": "An apple falling from a tree.",

      "concept": "Friction",
      "realWorldExample": "Rubbing your hands together to create warmth.",
      "explanation": "Friction is a force that opposes motion between surfaces in contact. The work done against friction converts kinetic energy into thermal energy (heat)."

      "realWorldExample": "Swinging a bucket of water in a vertical circle without spilling.",
      "explanation": "A force directed towards the center of the circular path (provided by the tension in your arm) keeps the bucket (and water) moving in a circle."

      "realWorldExample": "A straw appearing bent in a glass of water.",
      "explanation": "Light bends (refracts) when it passes from one medium (air) to another (water) at an angle, changing its speed and direction, creating the illusion."
